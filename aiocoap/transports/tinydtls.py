"""This module implements a TransportEndpoint that handles coaps:// using a
wrapped tinydtls library.

In order for this to run, the tinydtls cython wrapper from
https://git.fslab.de/jkonra2m/tinydtls must be available:

    $ git clone https://git.fslab.de/jkonra2m/tinydtls
    $ cd tinydtls
    $ autoreconf
    $ ./configure --with-ecc
    $ make
    $ cd cython
    $ python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

That cython directory must be in PYTHONPATH / sys.path.
